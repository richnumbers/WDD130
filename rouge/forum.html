            Inproving The Weaher System
        </h2>
        <p>
            The dynamic weather system in Falling Moon is evolving! Iâ€™m working on making rain splash realistically when it hits the ground, 
            adding more immersion to the environment. 
            Additionally, snow will now accumulate briefly before fading, creating a more natural and atmospheric effect. 
            These improvements will enhance the visual depth and realism of the game's weather mechanics. Stay tuned for more updates!

            The folloiwng image is what it will look like when working.

        <h2>
            Bosses now act differently with weather
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Falling Moon, boss fights are directly influenced by the dynamic weather system,
             making each encounter feel unique. Weather conditions will alter how bosses behave, affecting their attack patterns,
              movement, and abilities. A storm might make a boss more aggressive, while fog could limit visibility, 
              forcing players to fight more cautiously.
