            Falling Moon is the next type of Rouge-light games. where the weather will effect each run and how the monster act,
            and how the boss will fight

            Monsters will adapt to the environment, becoming more aggressive or defensive depending on the conditions.
             Bosses will harness the power of the weather, altering their attack patterns and abilities to match the rain or snow. 
             Players can strategically use weather-altering items to shift the tide of battle in their favor. 
             With a mix of exploration, combat, and ever-changing conditions, 
             Falling Moon offers an experience that keeps players on their toes.
